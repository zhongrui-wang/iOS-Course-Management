## Introduction:
Build up a course management iOS app in a team of four people. We use swift and firebase.<br> 
First is our calendar view controller, there are days with issues of one course. Click the cell, preview shows. Click the small calendar button, you can add the ta hours into the apple calendar. An alert of success  will display. Click read more button, detail view will display.<br> 
In the ta view controller, you can see all the tas and click the cell ta’s detail will display. It helps student to judge if attend to one’s ta hours.<br> 
In the forum view controller, you could post questions, post answers. First sign up or sign in with email and password. And then let’s have a try. <br>
